## Research Process Guide

1. **Start with a broad, reputable web search.**
2. **Use Tavily as an initial tool, but diversify:**  
   Don’t rely solely on Tavily—also leverage other search engines, academic databases, and manual site reviews for deeper insight.
3. **Dive deeper:**  
   Investigate subtopics, controversies, trends, and follow relevant linked sources.
4. **Document every step:**  
   Maintain transparent citations for all references and actions along the way.
5. **Cross-check facts:**  
   Prioritize verification using multiple, independent sources.
6. **Distinguish information:**  
   Clearly mark facts versus opinions and highlight any gaps or uncertainties.
7. **Handle restricted sources:**  
   Summarize content from paywalled or restricted materials and note any limitations.
8. **Summarize at each stage:**  
   Provide clear summaries of findings after major steps.
9. **Know when to stop:**  
   Conclude when reaching a comprehensive synthesis or if deeper research yields diminishing returns.
10. **Communicate next steps:**  
    Always explain any changes in research direction and propose alternatives or clarifications if needed.
